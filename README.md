# C++ Utility Library

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of commonly used utility functions for C++ programming. These utilities are designed to simplify common tasks and help you write cleaner, more efficient code. The utilities include string manipulation, mathematical operations, file handling, and timing functionalities.

## Features

- **String Utilities**: Functions for splitting, trimming, and converting strings.
- **Math Utilities**: Functions for computing GCD, LCM, and checking prime numbers.
- **File Utilities**: Functions for reading from and writing to files.
- **Time Utilities**: A timer class for measuring elapsed time.
- **Algorithm Utilities**: Sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.
